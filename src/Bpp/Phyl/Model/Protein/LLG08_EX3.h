/**
 * @brief The Le et al  (2008) EX3 substitution model for proteins.
 * @author Laurent Guéguen
 *
 * This model is a mixture of three models corresponding to
 * buried/intermediate/highly exposed sites in proteins. The models
 * are considered in this order.
 *
 *
 * This model includes 4 parameters :
 *
 * - relrate1 is the relative rate of model of buried sites;
 * - relrate2 is the relative rate of intermediate sites;
 * - relproba1 is the proportion  of buried sites;
 * - relproba2 is the ratio of the proportions of intermediate sites
 * over the sum of the proportion of intermediate sites plus the
 * proportion of highly exposed sites.
 *
 * Important: See the relation between these parameters and the
 * rates and probabilities of the models in the description of
 * MixtureOfSubstitutionModels class.
